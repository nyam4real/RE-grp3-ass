My experience at CodePlateau so far...
- first of all my name is Nyam
- i have never programmed, but it feels nice tryin a new think
- Ok, so the first week was basically theory which am cool with that!
- but the second week, the real deal mahn!
- nd in the course of it i was i bit backward cos had not sign up on Github yet plus other tech issue
- but thanks to our great instructors, you guyz rock! u ve really been of help tnx
- the class ve been cool but wish we can be broken into smaller grps
- i am also enjoying the vibe in our grp 3 assignment thumbs ups to Job nd codepla for the heads up
- i met old fnds nd also made new once too
- So, its been fun nd educating and i am resolute i'll be making progress
- plus thanks to the DG Daser and the state Government for creating an enabling ground! tnx
